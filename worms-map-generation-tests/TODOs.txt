add explosion sprites
add aiming reticle (read UI tutorials?)
get sprite animation working at some point
kill player if they fall below a certain level

more cell automata stuff
 - add edges to top of level
 - to find spawnable locations: flood fill sky and then find bottom edge?
 - make sure there are paths between rooms? (optional)
 - more scenes to test this? (smaller map size)

spawn player at an actual point on the map
 
improve map performance
 - explosion (more important)
 - initial map generation (less important)

map: once cell automata stuff is done then set remaining solid ground to texture values
