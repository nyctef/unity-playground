generate multiple collision meshes to get around 64k vertex limit
add explosions to destroy terrain at player location
add explosion sprites
add aiming reticle (read UI tutorials?)
get sprite animation working at some point

more cell automata stuff
 - add edges to top of level
 - to find spawnable locations: flood fill sky and then find bottom edge?
 - make sure there are paths between rooms? (optional)
 - more scenes to test this? (smaller map size)

map: once cell automata stuff is done then set remaining solid ground to texture values
