add some targets for explosions to hit

apply damage on explosions

apply explosive force on explosions

kill player/targets if they fall below a certain level

power meter for grenades

actually make a game:
 - multiple player characters
 - control multiple characters in sequence
 - start a game / finish a game
 - have some kind of menu state

common system for projectiles/players for things that can die and trigger events when they do?

more cell automata stuff
 - add edges to top of level
 - to find spawnable locations: flood fill sky and then find bottom edge?
 - make sure there are paths between rooms? (optional)
 - more scenes to test this? (smaller map size)

spawn player at an actual point on the map

hide reticle when moving?

pull wavyislandmapgenerator apart some more / properly

map: once cell automata stuff is done then set remaining solid ground to texture values

check out Unity 2018 beta for later C# support

fix EventManager errors on shutdown

add particles and more effects
 - dust puffs when jumping and landing
 - more explosion bits
 
figure out how to serialize maps - can we make startup faster if a map is already generated?

Is pushing aiming through the event system worth it?
 - In general, should we push all gameplay-critical logic through an event system in order to get replication/replays?
 
something like wallSpeedRetentionTimer for sideways jumps? Don't want to get stuck on terrain if we're just skimming over the top of it

Improve grenade sprite and make it a bit more unique
 - also a bit smaller?

Sprites for jumping animations

Could always look into map gen/explosion performance some more
